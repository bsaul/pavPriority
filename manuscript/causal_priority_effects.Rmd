## Introduction

* A point to perhaps make: In xxx ecology journals, xxx papers claim to estimate causal effects, [a lot fewer] make use of the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. 
* What are potential outcomes and how can the potential outcome/counterfactual approach to causality be useful for ecologists
* What can potential outcomes add that existing frameworks such as SEM miss:
  * notation aids in reasoning and naturally maps to “what if” questions that often motivate scientific inquiry. e.g. $Y(0)$ is the outcome under exposure $a = 0$
  * specification of estimand
  * clarify assumptions necessary to identify estimand from observable data
  * Nothing about statistical inference to this point; once estimand is defined and can be identified from data, then choose inference framework (frequentist, Bayesian, etc) to carry out inference.
* Using priority effects as an example, we show how priority effects can be cast in the potential outcomes framework. 

## Potential outcomes and links to other approaches

* Describe potential outcomes approach, brief background
* links to graphical models (DAGs) via single world intervention graphs
* links to SEM via assumptions implicitly made in an SEM 

## Causal Priority Effects

* Define priority effects and importance in ecology
* graph showing priority effects -- link this to causal mediation
* introduction mediation + parallels to SEM language
* might be nice to closely tie this with Fukami’s writings

## Specific example

* JA/SA experiment. interest is in mediation effects on disease outcome by intermediate infection.
* define effects of interest and state in terms of this example

## ETC/possible

* simulation study
* analysis of specific example
