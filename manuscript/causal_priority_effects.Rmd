# Introduction

The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. The order of arrival has ecological consequences. @fukami2015historical asserts the importance of historical contingency -- DESCRIBE -- to community ecology, despite being poorly understood and studied. In a host-multiple pathogen system, priority effects describe the …

Such questions are also causal: if species A had not arrived first, would outcomes for species B be different?Counterfactual questions like these are well suited for the potential framework of causal inference [@CITE]. The theory and application of causal inference has developed greatly in the past xxx years in the fields of epidemiology, xxx, and zzz. 

* Flesh out potential outcomes framework  
* Describe how causality is important to ecology, citations?

In this paper, we cast priority effects in the potential outcomes for causal inference and … 

* from our experiments, priority effect is one of causal mediation and/or interaction [define these]
* show how causal estimands can be estimated from experimental data. 
* In particular, we estimate causal mediation effects from a randomized experiment of salicyclic acid and jasmonic acid on disease outcome in tall fescue.

## Priority Effects

Describe priority effects and importance to ecology (based on @fukami2015historical)

* Is hypothesis in this experiment niche preemption or niche modification? I think modification, though this complicated if a species can change from (e.g.) biotroph to necrotroph.
* link priority effects to causal mediation:
   * mediation - how an effect occurs; interaction - for whom an effect occurs [@vanderweele2015explanation]
   * would be nice to map one of the figures in @fukami2015historical to the causal mediation SWIT

## A commonly used approach

Structural equation models are frequently used in ecological studies [@CITE], but parameters from these models may not carry a causal interpretation without assumptions often implicitly made. 

* the approach we describe starts from causal questions and works towards statistical “answers” (i.e. parameter estimates, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc)
* the typical approach, however, is to take statistical “answers” and assume they are causal
* a more principled approach is warranted and available
* @imai2010general argue the structural equation modeling approach to mediation “is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models.”


Problems with linear structural equation models [@imai2010general]:

* within LSEM, causal mediation effects are defined relative to particular statistical models
* not generalization to nonlinear models [is this true for the SEM framework?]

An advantage of the potential outcome approach is that the causal effects can be defined, identified, and estimators derived without reference to specific statistical models [@imai2010general].

## Use of the Potential Outcomes Framework

@petersen2014causal laid forth a step-by-step process for applying the potential outcomes framework:

1. Use existing knowledge and theory to specify causal model.
2. Specify observed data and link to causal model [Think about how to incorporate this]
3. Specify causal estimand
4. Determine whether causal estimand is identifiable from data
5. Choose statistical model
6. Choose estimator and estimate
7. Interpret

Step 4 is the critical link between causal models to statistical models and ultimately estimating parameters from statistical using observed data. This step is not always possible, or at least the assumptions too strong for the comfort level of the researchers. @petersen2014causal point out: “In many cases, rigorous application of a formal causal framework forces us to conclude that existing knowledge and data are insufficient to claim identifiability--in itself a useful contribution.”

This approach not yet widely applied in ecology…

But mediation is a common concept [citations]

# A Causal Model for Priority Effects

## Experiment

Describe the experiment that was run:

* experimental treatments
* what was measured

Describe study predictions or hypotheses.

## Notation

* Define units
* Define variables

Let $A$ be experiment treatment to either control = 0 [what was control?], salicylic acid (SA) = 1, or jasmonic acid (JA) = 2. Let $M(a)$ be the *potential* time to visible symptoms by *collectotricum*. Let $Y(a, m)$ be the potential severity of rhizoc infection XX weeks after the experiment began. Let $V$ be measured baseline covariates taken at the time of treatment and $L$ be covariates measured after treatment was applied.

* Is $M(a)$ time to infection or just an indicator of infection? Latter is probably easier to deal with.
* Is $M(a)$ infection by either collectotricum or rhizoctonium (or nothing) (i.e. a competing risks problem) or just infection by, say, just collectotricum or not?

Assumes no-interference. Plausible here? Are units far enough away in space such that treatment of one unit does not effect outcome in another unit?

## Graphical Model

The more algebraic potential outcomes (sometimes referred to as the counterfactual or Rubin causal model [holland1986]) and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have sometimes been viewed as different approaches for understanding causality. We see both approaches as useful and we use single world intervention graphs (SWIGs) or single world intervention templates (SWITs) [@richardson2013primer] to explicitly represent potential outcomes on a graph

## Possible Estimands - targets of inference

First we layout a generic framework defining causal effects before specifying priority causal effects. 

A causal effect is in general a contrast between a functional, denoted $\mathcal{F}$, of the distribution of potential outcomes under different settings. 

\[
CE[Y(a, m), Y(a’, m’); \mathcal{F}]
\]

Often $\mathcal{F} \coloneqq \mathrm{E}(\cdot)$, i.e., an expectation, but other features of the distribution such as quantiles or survival curves may be of interest too. The contrast function may be the difference, ratio, odds ratio, or whatever. 

Here, we follow @imai2010general in defining causal mediation effects.

Average direct effect of treatment:

\[
DE(a, a’, a^{\star}) = \mathrm{E}[Y(a, M(a^{\star})) - Y(a’, M(a^{\star}))]
\]

This the effect of setting treatment from $a$ to $a’$ while the mediator takes the value it would take under $a^{\star}$, allowing for $a^{\star} = a$ or $a’$.

Average causal mediation effect (the effect of the treatment through the mediator):

\[
ME(a, a’, a^{\star}) = \mathrm{E}[Y(a, M(a’)) - Y(a, M(a^{\star}))]
\]

For example, $ME(0, 1, 1) = \mathrm{E}[Y(0, M(1)) - Y(0, M(0))]$ asks the question: what would be the effect on the outcome of changing the mediator from its value under control to its value under SA while holding the treatment at the control value? 

A table or figure describing the link between hypotheses and causal effects:

* Fletcher: lay out hypotheses about effects of SA and JA and how you expect these effects to be mediated.

## Identifiability Assumptions

\[
Y(a, m), M(a) \perp A | L = l
\]


\[
Y(a, m) \perp M(a) | A, L = l
\]

First holds trivially due to randomization.

Second is strong assumption. $L$ are *pretreatment* variables. Further assumptions are needed for time-varying confounding.


	

# Mapping to a statistical model

* note that we don’t make no-interaction assumption.

# Discussion
Worth discussing @suzuki2011identification and the sufficient cause model?
