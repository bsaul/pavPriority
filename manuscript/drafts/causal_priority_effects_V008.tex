\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Despite being poorly understood and studied, priority effects -- the
order and timing of species arrival -- have ecological consequences
(Fukami 2015). Priority effects invite counterfactual reasoning: if
species A arrives first would outcomes for species B be different
compared to a world where species B arrived first? Such counterfactual
questions are well-suited for the potential framework of causal
inference (VanderWeele 2015).

To study within-host priority effects, Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell (2017) conducted an experiment wherein three cohorts of
sentinel, pathogen-naive tall fescue (\emph{Festuca arundinacea}) plants
where placed in a field at three different timepoints during the year.
The timepoints were chosen to correspond to periods of high prevelance
during the annual epidemic cycles for each of three tall fescue fungal
pathogens: \emph{Colletotrichum} (early summer), \emph{Rhizoctonia} (mid
summer), and \emph{Puccinia} (late summer) (Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell 2017).

In this paper, priority effects are defined as contrasts of potential
outcomes, hence under assumptions that we detail these effect have a
causal interpretation and may be estimated from data.

\hypertarget{priority-effects}{%
\subsection{Priority Effects}\label{priority-effects}}

Describe priority effects and importance to ecology (based on Fukami
(2015))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is hypothesis in this experiment niche preemption or niche
  modification? I think modification, though this complicated if a
  species can change from (e.g.) biotroph to necrotroph.
\item
  would be nice to map one of the figures in Fukami (2015) to the causal
  mediation SWIT
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{causal-inference-using-potential-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Causal inference using potential
outcomes}\label{causal-inference-using-potential-outcomes}}

Structural equation models (Shipley 2016) are popular in biology and
ecology; however, parameters from these models may not carry a causal
interpretation without assumptions often implicitly made (Imai, Keele,
and Tingley 2010).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the approach we describe starts from causal questions and works
  towards statistical ``answers'' (i.e.~parameter estimates, confidence
  intervals, hypothesis tests, etc)
\item
  the typical approach, however, is to take statistical ``answers'' and
  assume they are causal
\item
  a more principled approach is warranted and available
\item
  Imai, Keele, and Tingley (2010) argue the structural equation modeling
  approach to mediation ``is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a
  general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a
  particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key
  identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the
  framework to nonlinear models.''
\end{itemize}

An advantage of the potential outcome approach is that the causal
effects can be defined, identified, and estimators derived without
reference to specific statistical models (Imai, Keele, and Tingley
2010).

\hypertarget{a-causal-model-for-priority-effects}{%
\section{A Causal Model for Priority
Effects}\label{a-causal-model-for-priority-effects}}

To test for priority effects, the following ideal experiment would be
run:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  describe an idealized randomized experiment
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notation}{%
\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}}

Let \(Y^p_{ij}\) be an indicator of observed visible symptoms of
pathogen \(p\) at 4 weeks after leaf emergence in sentinel plant (host)
\(i = 1, \dots, m\) and leaf \(j = 1, \dots, n_i\). Let \(A^{p'}_{ij}\)
be an indicator of infection (confirmed by visible symptoms) by pathogen
\(p'\) during the time between leaf emergence and up to three weeks
after emergence but before any indication of pathogen \(p\) infection
during that time. {[}NEED TO CLARIFY: Is this exposure defined by the
outcome? Is this problematic?{]}

Let \(S^{p'}_{ij}\) be the the proportion of leaves in plant \(i\), not
including leaf \(j\) infected by pathogen \(p'\) at the time of leaf
\(j\) emergence. Let \(W^{p}_{ij}\) and \(W^{p'}_{ij}\)be the average
number of leaves infected by pathogen \(p\) and \(p'\), respectively in
other experimental plants other than plant \(i\) at the time of leaf
\(j\) emergence. Let \(L_{ij}\) be other a vector of other baseline
covariates measured at leaf \(j\) emergence, such as calendar time, host
age, and leaf age.

Define the average potential infection of leaf \(j\) by pathogen \(p\)
had it been exposed to pathogen \(p'\) and within host prevelance at
emergence as
\(\bar{Y}_{ij} = \sum_{\mathcal{A}} Y^p_{ij}(a^{p'}, s^{p'}) \omega(\alpha; \cdot)\)
{[}TODO: define \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\omega\) and \(\alpha\){]}
(Barkley et al. 2017). Define the average \emph{within plant} potential
outcome as
\(\bar{Y}^p_i(a^{p'}, s^{p'}) = \sum_{j}^{n_i} Y^p_{ij}(a^{p'}, s^{p'})\)
and average \emph{population} potential outcome as
\(\bar{Y}^p(a^{p'}, s^{p'}) = \sum_{i}^{m} \bar{Y}^p_{i}(a^{p'}, s^{p'})\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume no interference between plants (clustered interference).
  Explain why this is/isn't reasonable for causal effect. Also, I've
  dropped the tiller level here. Is this reasonable? NOTE: Corelation
  due to plant-tiller-leaf nesting can still be accounted for in
  statistical model; concern here is causal model.
\item
  TODO:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    add cohort effect; add as effect modifier? baseline covariate?
  \item
    add endophtye effect; as effect modifier?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{causal-effects-estimands}{%
\subsubsection{Causal effects
(estimands)}\label{causal-effects-estimands}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Average within leaf priority effect:
  \(LPE^p(\alpha) = \bar{Y}^p(1; \alpha) - \bar{Y}^p(0; \alpha)\). This
  the average effect of prior infection by pathogen \(p'\) on subsequent
  infection by pathogen \(p\) within a leaf, under assignment scheme
  \(\alpha\). A positive value suggests prior \(p'\) infection
  facilitates subesequent \(p\) infection; a negative value suggests
  \(p'\) suppresses \(p\) infection.
\item
  Average uninfected within host priority effect:
  \(UHPE^p(0, \alpha, \alpha') = \bar{Y}^p(0; \alpha) - \bar{Y}^p(0; \alpha')\).
  This is the average effect of modifying within host assignment scheme
  from \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha'\) in leaves not infected by \(p'\).
\item
  Average infected within host priority effect:
  \(IHPE^p(1, \alpha, \alpha') = \bar{Y}^p(1; \alpha) - \bar{Y}^p(1; \alpha')\).
  This is the average effect of modifying within host assignment scheme
  from \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha'\) in leaves infected by \(p'\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  link back to Halliday, Umbanhowar, and Mitchell (2017)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    is death of leaf a censoring event or competing risk? There's a
    complication that leaves only live a certain period of time - during
    which they are either infected or not - but it is not as if a leaf
    \emph{could} survive for longer during which time we could observe
    the outcome. Then there's the fact that leaves in the last cohort
    can't be observed for the same length of time as other cohorts due
    to end of study and senesence.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  link priority effects to causal mediation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mediation - how an effect occurs; interaction - for whom an effect
    occurs (VanderWeele 2015)
  \end{itemize}
