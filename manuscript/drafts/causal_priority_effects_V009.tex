\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Despite being poorly understood and studied, priority effects -- the
order and timing of species arrival -- have ecological consequences
(Fukami 2015). Priority effects invite counterfactual reasoning: if
species A arrives first would outcomes for species B be different
compared to a world where species B arrived first? Such counterfactual
questions are well-suited for the potential framework of causal
inference (VanderWeele 2015).

To study within-host priority effects, Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell (2017) conducted an experiment wherein three cohorts of
sentinel, pathogen-naive tall fescue (\emph{Festuca arundinacea}) plants
where placed in a field at three different timepoints during the year.
The timepoints were chosen to correspond to periods of high prevelance
during the annual epidemic cycles for each of three tall fescue fungal
pathogens: \emph{Colletotrichum} (early summer), \emph{Rhizoctonia} (mid
summer), and \emph{Puccinia} (late summer) (Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell 2017).

In this paper, priority effects are defined as contrasts of potential
outcomes, hence under assumptions that we detail these effects have a
causal interpretation and may be estimated from observed data.

\hypertarget{priority-effects}{%
\subsection{Priority Effects}\label{priority-effects}}

Describe priority effects and importance to ecology (based on Fukami
(2015))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is hypothesis in this experiment niche preemption or niche
  modification? I think modification, though this complicated if a
  species can change from (e.g.) biotroph to necrotroph.
\item
  would be nice to map one of the figures in Fukami (2015) to the causal
  graph
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{causal-inference-using-potential-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Causal inference using potential
outcomes}\label{causal-inference-using-potential-outcomes}}

Structural equation models (Shipley 2016) are popular in biology and
ecology; however, parameters from these models may not carry a causal
interpretation without assumptions often implicitly made (Imai, Keele,
and Tingley 2010). Similarly, it is not uncommon for authors to discuss
the results of associational statistical models in terms of causal
language. In this paper, we begin by explicitly define causal questions
in terms of potential outcomes and work forward from there. An advantage
of the potential outcome approach is that the causal effects can be
defined, identified, and estimators derived without reference to
specific statistical models (Imai, Keele, and Tingley 2010).

\hypertarget{discrete-time-causal-models-for-within-host-priority-effects}{%
\section{Discrete-Time Causal Models for Within-Host Priority
Effects}\label{discrete-time-causal-models-for-within-host-priority-effects}}

A goal of the model is to make comparisons such as:

\emph{Direct effects}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how does the risk of Rhizoc infection change had the leaf not been
  infected by Collec at the previous timepoint \emph{versus} not having
  been infected by Collec, holding within-plant Rhizoc intensity and
  within-plant Coll intensity fixed.
\item
  how does the risk of Coll infection change had the leaf not been
  infected by Rhizoc at the previous timepoint \emph{versus} not having
  been infected by Rhizoc, holding within-plant Rhizoc intensity and
  within-plant Coll intensity fixed.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Within-plant spillover effects}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how does the risk of Rhizoc infection change had the within-plant
  Rhizoc intensity been \(X\) versus \(X'\) and within-plant Coll
  intensity fixed and not having been infected by Collec
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notation}{%
\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  TODO Define within-plant pressure parameters:
\end{itemize}

Define \(A_{ijt} = (R_{ijt}, C_{ijt})^\intercal\) be the indicators of
observed infection status by pathogens \(Rhizoctonia\) and \(Coll\) at
weeks \(t > 0\) after leaf emergence on leaf \(j = 1, \dots, n_i\) in
plant \(i = 1, \dots, m\). Let \(t = 0\) be the first week the leaf
emergence. Let \(L_{ijt}\) be covariates measured in the time up to the
timepoint \(t\), \(D_{ijt}\) be an indicator that a leaf is alive (1) or
not (0) at \(t\), and \(H_{i} \in \{1, 2, 3\}\) indicate plant \(i\)'s
randomly assigned cohort.

Denote the random matrix of infection exposures for all \(n_{i}\) leaves
in plant \(i\) at time \(t\) as
\(A_{it} = (A_{i1t} , \dots, A_{in_it})\), and let
\(A_{i\setminus j, t}\) be the submatrix of \(A_{it}\) of exposure for
all leaves other than the \(j\)th one. Lower-case letters denote
possible realizations of \(A_{ijt}\), \(A_{i\setminus j, t}\), and
\(A_i\): \(a_{ijt}\), \(a_{i\setminus j, t}\) and \(a_{it}\),
respectively. Define
\(\omega(a_{t}; \rho) = \Pr_{\rho}(A_{it} = a_{t})\) as the marginal
probability under within-plant pressure
\(\rho = (\rho^r_{t-1}, \rho^c_{t-1})\) that a host plant experiences
\(a_t\) at time \(t\).

\hypertarget{causal-effects-estimands}{%
\subsection{Causal effects (estimands)}\label{causal-effects-estimands}}

For each \(t\), the average potential outcomes are defined for each
pathogen under the case that the pathogen infection statuses had been
\(a_{t - 1} = (r_{t-1}, c_{t -1})\) and the within-host pressure had
been \(\rho\) in the previous week. Additionally, we define this
estimand as conditional upon not having add been previously infected by
the same pathogen, not having died, and the cohort assignment. Death is
a competing risk, so the estimand is defined on being conditional the
leaves alive at time \(t\). Also, as we may expect the effects to be
different across cohorts, we define the effects to be different. But we
do not define the potential outcomes as functions of the cohort since we
do not think that the underlying causal processes are dependent on the
timing of the cohort's placement in the field.

\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
\mu^r_{ht}(a_{t-1}, \rho) \\
\mu^c_{ht}(a_{t-1}, \rho) 
\end{pmatrix} &= E
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
  \bar{R}_{t}(a_{t-1}, \rho) | R_{t-1} = 0, D_t = 0, H = h \\ 
  \bar{C}_{t}(a_{t-1}, \rho) | C_{t-1} = 0, D_t = 0, H = h
\end{array}
\right\} \\
&= 
E \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
  \sum_{\mathbf{a}_{i \setminus j}} R_{t}(a_{t-1}; \rho) \omega(a_{t-1}; \rho) | R_{t-1} = 0, D = 0, H = h \\ 
  \sum_{\mathbf{a}_{i \setminus j}} C_{t}(a_{t-1}; \rho) \omega(a_{t-1}; \rho) | C_{t-1} = 0, D = 0, H = h
\end{array}
\right\}
,
\end{align*}

where
\(\sum_{\mathbf{a}_{i \setminus j}} \equiv \sum_{\mathbf{r}_{i \setminus j}} \sum_{\mathbf{c}_{i\setminus j}}\)
and \(E(\cdot)\) is the expected value in the super-population of
plants.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    is death of leaf a censoring event or competing risk? There's a
    complication that leaves only live a certain period of time - during
    which they are either infected or not - but it is not as if a leaf
    \emph{could} survive for longer during which time we could observe
    the outcome. Then there's the fact that leaves in the last cohort
    can't be observed for the same length of time as other cohorts due
    to end of study and senesence.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  link priority effects to causal mediation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mediation - how an effect occurs; interaction - for whom an effect
    occurs (VanderWeele 2015)
