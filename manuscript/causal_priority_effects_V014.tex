\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\noindent The order in which different pathogens arrive on a host can
effect whether and how those pathogens are able to infect a host. When
hosts are separated sufficiently (e.g.~by space and/or time), it may be
reasonable to assume that such priority effects in one host would not
affect priority effects in another host. In causal inference
terminology, this amounts to a no-interference assumption. In nested or
proximal host-pathogens systems, this assumption may not hold; and
moreover, estimates of the within-host priority effect may be conflated
with the effects of infections on other hosts. In this paper, priority
effects are defined as contrasts of potential outcomes that may depend
not only on the host's past infection status, but also on the infection
status of other hosts. In this way, we clarify within-host priority
effects from the indirect effects from other hosts.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Despite being poorly understood and studied, priority effects -- the
order and timing of species arrival -- have ecological consequences
(Fukami 2015). Priority effects invite counterfactual reasoning: if
species A arrives first would outcomes for species B be different
compared to a world where species B arrived first? Such counterfactual
questions are well-suited for the potential framework of causal
inference (VanderWeele 2015).

To study within-host priority effects, Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell (2017) conducted an experiment wherein three cohorts of
sentinel, pathogen-naive tall fescue (\emph{Festuca arundinacea}) plants
where placed in a field at three different timepoints during the year.
The timepoints were chosen to correspond to periods of high prevelance
during the annual epidemic cycles for each of three tall fescue fungal
pathogens: \emph{Colletotrichum} (early summer), \emph{Rhizoctonia} (mid
summer), and \emph{Puccinia} (late summer) (Halliday, Umbanhowar, and
Mitchell 2017).

In this paper, priority effects are defined as contrasts of potential
outcomes, hence under assumptions that we detail these effects have a
causal interpretation and may be estimated from observed data.

The paper is organized as follows. In the remainder of Section
\ref{introduction}, we introduce priority effects and briefly describe
the hypotheses and experiment of Halliday, Umbanhowar, and Mitchell
(2017), before acquainting readers with the potential outcomes approach
to causal inference. In Section \ref{causal_model}, the causal model is
defined and visualized using Single World Intervention Graphs
(Richardson and Robins 2013). The causal effects described and
interpreted along with the necessary assumptions to identify these
effects from observed data. Our approach to estimation is specified in
Section \ref{estimations}. An analysis of the data from Halliday,
Umbanhowar, and Mitchell (2017) is presented in Section \ref{results}.
Lastly, we discuss implications in Section \ref{discussion}.

In this paper, causal research questions about priority effects are
explicity defined in terms of potential outcomes. Using a potential
outcome approach, causal parameters can be defined and estimators
derived without reference to specific statistical models (Imai, Keele,
and Tingley 2010).

\section{Discrete-Time Causal Model for Within-Host Priority
Effects}\label{causal_model}}

\hypertarget{approach-1-a-la-hudgen-and-halloran-2008}{%
\subsection{Approach 1 : a la Hudgen and Halloran
(2008)}\label{approach-1-a-la-hudgen-and-halloran-2008}}

A goal for our causal model is to be able to express comparisons such
as: how does the risk of \emph{Colletotrichum} infection change had the
leaf not been infected by \emph{Rhizoctonia} at the previous timepoint
\emph{versus} not having been infected by \emph{Rhizoctonia}, holding
both the ``pressure'' (defined below) of \emph{Rhizoctonia} and
\emph{Colletotrichum} from other leaves on the same plant fixed? Or how
does a host's risk of \emph{Rhizoctonia} infection change had the
\emph{Rhizoctonia} pressure from other leaves changed but
\emph{Colletotrichum} pressure was held fixed and the host had not been
previously infected by \emph{Colletotrichum}?

Define \(\mathsf{I}_{jkt} = (C_{jkt}, R_{jkt}, P_{jkt})^\intercal\) as
the indicators of observed infection status by pathogens
\emph{Colletotrichum}, \emph{Rhizoctonia}, and \emph{Puccinia} at week
\(t = 1, \dots,\) after the start of the experiment on leaf
\(k = 1, \dots, n_{jt}\) in plant \(j = 1, \dots, m\). Let \(D_{jkt}\)
be an indicator that a leaf is alive (1) or not (0) at \(t\);
\(H_{j} \in \{1, 2, 3\}\) indicate plant \(j\)'s randomly assigned
cohort; \(A_{jkt}\) be a leaf's age (in weeks) on week \(t\); and
\(L_{jkt}\) be additional covariates such as abiotic factors measured in
the time up to the timepoint \(t\),

Denote the random matrix of infection exposures for all \(n_{jt}\)
leaves in plant \(j\) at time \(t\) as
\(\mathsf{I}_{kt} = (\mathsf{I}_{j1t} , \dots, \mathsf{I}_{kn_jt})\),
and let \(\mathsf{I}_{j \setminus k, t}\) be the submatrix of
\(\mathsf{I}_{jt}\) of exposure for all leaves other than the \(j\)th
one. Lower-case letters denote possible realizations of
\(\mathsf{I}_{jkt}\), \(\mathsf{I}_{j \setminus k, t}\), and
\(\mathsf{I}_{k}\): \(\mathsf{i}_{jkt}\),
\(\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k, t}\) and \(\mathsf{i}_{kt}\), respectively.
Define
\(\omega(\mathsf{i}_{t}; \rho) = \Pr_{\rho}(\mathsf{I}_{jt} = \mathsf{i}_{t})\)
as the marginal probability that a plant experiences \(\mathsf{i}_t\) at
time \(t\), where \(\rho = (\rho^c_{t}, \rho^r_{t}, \rho^p_{t})\) are
the (possibly vector-valued) parameters that rule \(\omega\). For
example, dropping the dependence on \(t\) for notation simplicity, an
assumption of:

\begin{align*}
\omega(\mathsf{i}; \rho) &= \Pr(C_{j}; \rho^c) \Pr(R_{j}; \rho^r) \Pr(P_{j}; \rho^p) \\
&= \prod_{k}^{n_{j}} {\rho^c}^{C_j} (1 - \rho_c)^{1 - C_j} {\rho^r}^{R_j} (1 - \rho^r)^{1 - R_j} {\rho^p}^{P_j} (1 - \rho^p)^{1 - P_j}
\end{align*}

is equivalent to assuming that each leaf is exposed to each pathogen
independently of other leafs and other pathogens; i.e., a kind of
restricted multinomial distribution. We do not make this assumption, but
include this comment for illustration of the types of distributional
assumptions that could be made about \(\omega(\mathsf{i}_{t}; \rho)\).
We call \(\rho\) the within-plant pressure, or simply pressure,
parameters as these parameters control how infections are distributed
within a plant.

For each \(t\), the average potential outcomes are defined for each
pathogen under the case that the pathogen infection statuses had been
\(\mathsf{i}_{t - 1} = (c_{t -1}, r_{t-1}, p_{t-1})\) and the
within-host pressure had been \(\rho\) in the previous week:

\begin{align*}
\mu_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu^c_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) \\
  \mu^r_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) \\
  \mu^p_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) 
\end{pmatrix} &= 
\mathrm{E} 
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
  \bar{C}_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) \\
  \bar{R}_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) \\ 
  \bar{P}_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) 
\end{array}
\right\} \\
&= 
\mathrm{E} \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
  \sum_{\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k}} C_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho) \omega(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho)  \\
  \sum_{\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k}} R_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho) \omega(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho)  \\ 
  \sum_{\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k}} P_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho) \omega(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}; \rho) 
\end{array}
\right\}
,
\end{align*}

where
\(\sum_{\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k}} \equiv \sum_{\mathbf{r}_{j \setminus k}} \sum_{\mathbf{c}_{j \setminus k}} \sum_{\mathbf{p}_{j \setminus k}}\)
and \(\mathrm{E}(\cdot)\) is the expected value in the super-population
of plants.

\hypertarget{estimands}{%
\subsubsection{Causal effects (estimands)}\label{estimands}}

Host death is a competing risk to infection. Indeed, some of the
pathogens may induce death. DISCUSSION competing risk (Young, Tchetgen
Tchetgen, and Hernán 2018). So we define causal effects as conditional
upon a host begin alive at time \(t\). Additionally, causal effects are
defined conditional upon not having add been previously infected by the
same pathogen. Cohort assignment and leaf age are included as effect
modifiers, as cohort timing and leaf age are relevant to research
questions. In summary, causal effects are generally denoted as:

\[
\theta_{aht}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho, \mathsf{i}'_{t-1}, \rho') = E[\mu_{t}(\mathsf{i}_{t-1}, \rho) - \mu_{t}(\mathsf{i}'_{t-1}, \rho') |  A = a, H = h, C_{t-1} = 0, D_t = 0]
\]

Table \ref{tab:estimands} provides a typology of estimands under
consideration for this study. For example,
\(AL[(1, 0, 0)^{\intercal}, (0, 0, 0)^{\intercal}, \rho]\) would compare
the average potential outcomes under the setting where a leaf is
infected by \emph{Colletotrichum} and nothing else in the previous week
versus the setting where leaves where not infected by any pathogen, for
a fixed \(\rho\). In essense, this is a comparison of the probability of
infection by each of three pathogens in week \(t\) under two different
settings of the previous week: a leaf is infected by
\emph{Colletotrichum} only versus no infections with the pressure
parameter held at \(\rho\).

Under this setup, a variety of interesting causal questions can be
asked. Whether and how these quantities can be estimated from data will
be considered in Section XXX.

\hypertarget{approach-2-snm}{%
\subsection{Approach 2 : SNM}\label{approach-2-snm}}

For ease of notation for now, consider two pathogens. Let (e.g.)
\(C^{\star}_t = \sum_{\mathsf{i}_{j \setminus k}} C_{ik}/n_{it}\) be the
proportion of leaves on plant \(j\) other than leaf \(k\) infected by
\emph{Collectrichum}. Define \(R^{\star}_t\) similarly.

Define potential outcomes as (e.g.):
\(C_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}) = C_t(\mathsf{i}_{t -1})\).
Then define a structural nested model as:

\begin{align*}
g \left\{ E \left( 
 \begin{array}{l}
  C_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}) \\
  C_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, 0, 0) \\
  R_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}) \\
  R_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, 0, 0) \\
 \end{array} \bigg| A_t = a_t, H = h
\right)  \right\} -  
g \left\{ E \left( 
 \begin{array}{l}
  C_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, 0, 0) \\
  C_t(0, 0, 0, 0) \\
  R_t(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, 0, 0) \\
  R_t(0, 0, 0, 0) \\
 \end{array} \bigg| A_t = a_t, H = h
\right)  \right\} &= \\ 
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_1(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
\gamma_2(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
\gamma_3(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
\gamma_4(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

For example,

\begin{align*} 
\gamma = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\psi^c_{c^{\star}} c^{\star}_{t-1} + \psi^c_{r^{\star}} r^{\star}_{t-1} \\
\psi^c_{c} c_{t-1} + \psi^c_{r} r_{t-1} + \psi^c_{ca} c_{t-1} a + \psi^c_{ch} c_{t-1} h \\
\psi^r_{c^{\star}} c^{\star}_{t-1} + \psi^r_{r^{\star}} r^{\star}_{t-1} \\
\psi^r_{c} c_{t-1} + \psi^r_{r} r_{t-1} + \psi^r_{ra} r_{t-1} a + \psi^r_{rh} r_{t-1} h
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

For estimation, use transformed outcomes, assuming \(g = identity\):

\[
U =
\begin{pmatrix}
C_t  - \gamma_1(c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
C_t  - \gamma_2(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi)  \\
R_t  - \gamma_3(c^{\star}_{t-1}, r^{\star}_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi) \\
R_t  - \gamma_4(c_{t-1}, r_{t-1}, a_t, h; \psi)  \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Then we'll need (assuming the parametrization defined for \(\gamma\):

\[
\frac{\partial U}{\partial \psi^{\intercal}} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
C^{\star}_{t-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
R^{\star}_{t-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & C_{t-1} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & R_{t-1} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & C_{t-1} A_t & 0 & 0 \\
0 & C_{t-1} H & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & C^{\star}_{t-1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & R^{\star}_{t-1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & C_{t-1}  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & R_{t-1} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & C_{t-1} A_t  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & C_{t-1} H   \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

the plant's infection status as:

\[
\Pr(\mathsf{I}_{jt} = \mathsf{i}_{jt} | L_{jt}) = \int \prod_{k = 1}^{n_j}h\{\Pr(\mathsf{I}_{jkt} = \mathsf{i}_{jkt}  | L_{jkt}, b_{jt})\}^{I(\mathsf{I}_{jkt} = \mathsf{i}_{jkt} )} f(b_{jt}) \mathsf{d}b_{jt}

    is death of leaf a censoring event or competing risk? There's a
    complication that leaves only live a certain period of time - during
    which they are either infected or not - but it is not as if a leaf
    \emph{could} survive for longer during which time we could observe
    the outcome. Then there's the fact that leaves in the last cohort
    can't be observed for the same length of time as other cohorts due
    to end of study and senesence.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Structural equation models (Shipley 2016) are popular in biology and
  ecology; however, parameters from these models may not carry a causal
  interpretation without assumptions often implicitly made (Imai, Keele,
  and Tingley 2010). Similarly, it is not uncommon for authors to
  discuss the results of associational statistical models in terms of
  causal language.
