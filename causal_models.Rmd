Consider the following individual causal model (assume SUTVA):

\begin{align*}
\label{causal_model}
x_1(a_0) &= x_1(0)  + \theta a_0 \\
x_2(a_1, a_0) &= x_2(0, a_0)  + \theta a_1 \\
x_2(0, a_0) &= x_1(a_0) + \delta
\end{align*}

or more compactly,

\begin{align*}
x_1(a_0) &= x_1(0)  + \theta a_0 \\
x_2(a_1, a_0) &= x_1(a_0) + \delta  + \theta a_1 \\
\end{align*}

From the first line, for a hypothesized value of $\theta$, $\theta^o$, a candidate uniformity outcome is: $x_1^{o:1\to1}(0) = x_1 - \theta^o a_0$. Combining both equations gives another mapping back to $x_1(0)$ from the second timepint: $x_1^{o:2\to1}(0) = x_2 - (\delta^o + \theta^o(a_0 + a_1))$. The $t \to 1$ notation just indicates a mapping from the observed outcome at time $t$ back to the potential outcome at time 1.

Based on this model, for a hypothesized value of $\theta^o$ and $\delta^o$, there are two ways to map back to the potential outcome at time 1 where the unit receives no treatment from the observed outcomes :

\[
x_1^{o}(0) =
\begin{cases}
x_1 - \theta^o a_0 \\
x_2 - (\delta^o + \theta^o(a_0 + a_1))
\end{cases}
\]

Note that these candidate values should be the same when evaluated at the true parameters.
