# Multistate models

Let $(C, C^{\star}, R)$ be the infection state of a leaf where $C^{\star}$ is the an indicator that the proportion of other leaves on the same plant infected with $C$ is $>0.25$.

Consider models for the following two settings, one including $C^{\star}$ (simple), another including $C^{\star}$ (interference).

The simple model has 5 states:

* 1 = (C = 0, R = 0)
* 2 = (C = 1, R = 0)
* 3 = (0, 1)
* 4 = (1, 1)
* 5 = X - death


The inteference model has 9 states:

* 1 = $(C = 0, C^{\star} = 0, R = 0)$
* 2 = (1, 0, 0)
* 3 = (0, 1, 0)
* 4 = (0, 0, 1)
* 5 = (1, 1, 0)
* 6 = (0, 1, 1)
* 7 = (1, 0, 1)
* 8 = (1, 1, 1)
* 9 = X - death


Assumptions

* no recovery (leaf can't become uninfected by a pathogen)

The following are the allowed transitions for each model. Zeros indicate a transition from state $i$ to $j$ is not permitted (except for diagonals -- leaves remain in the same state). The non-zero values don't matter.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Q_censor <- rbind(
  c(0, 1, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0, 0, 1),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0)
)

Q_simple <- rbind(
  c(0, 1,  1, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0,  0, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0,  0, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0,  0, 1, 1),
  c(0, 0,  0, 0, 0)
)

Q_interfere <- rbind(
  c(0, 1, 1, 1,  1,  1,  1,  1, 1),
  c(0,  0,  0,  0, .2,  0, .1, .1, .1),
  c(.1,  .1,  0,  0, .2, .1,  0, .1, .1),

```{r, echo = FALSE}
compare_probs <- function(msmfit, t, i1, i2, label){
  n  <- length(t)
  P  <- pmatrix.msm(msmfit, t = t)
  p1 <- apply(P, 3, function(x) x[i1[1], i1[2]])
  p2 <- apply(P, 3, function(x) x[i2[1], i2[2]])
  
  data_frame(
    label = label,
    comparison = sprintf("Pr(%s|%s)vPr(%s|%s)", i1[2], i1[1], i2[2], i2[1]),
    t = t,
    p1 = p1,
    p2 = p2,
    rd = p1 - p2,
    rr = p1/p2
  )
}
```

In the following plot, `p1` is $\Pr(\text{in state } j \text{ by time } t | \text{in state } i \text{ now}  )$. `p2` is $\Pr(\text{in state } i \text{ by time } t | \text{in state } i \text{ now}  )$ (i.e., the probability of remaining in the same state). `rd` is the risk difference `p1 - p2` and `rr` is the risk ratio `p1/p2`. The model is a continuous time markov model so the interpretation of the transition probabilities are: given that a host in state $i$ at time $t^{\star}$, what is the probability of transition to state $j$ at time $t^{\star} + t$.

In the figure, I compare the following transition probabilities:

* becoming infected with $C$ given that a host is current not infected by $C$ but is infected by $R$ (state 3 $\to$ 4 in the simple model and censoring model)
* becoming infected with $C$ given that a host is current not infected by $C$ but is infected by $R$ *and is not* surrounded by other $C$ infected leaves (state 4 $\to$ 6 in the interference model)
* becoming infected with $C$ given that a host is current not infected by $C$ but is infected by $R$ *and is* surrounded by other $C$ infected leaves (state 6 $\to$ 8 in the interference model)

to the probability of staying in the first state (e.g. remaining in state 3 for the simple model).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=7}
X <- bind_rows(
  compare_probs(censor_msm, t = 1:35, i1 = c(3,4), i2 = c(3,3),
                   label = "From 3 to 4 given 3 (Censored on Death)"),
  compare_probs(simple_msm, t = 1:35, i1 = c(3,4), i2 = c(3,3),
                   label = "From 3 to 4 given 4"),
  compare_probs(interfere_msm, t = 1:35, i1 = c(4,7), i2 = c(4,4),
                   label = "From 4 to 7 given 4"),
  compare_probs(interfere_msm, t = 1:35, i1 = c(6,8), i2 = c(6,6),
                 label = "From 6 to 8 given 6")
)

X %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = "metric", value = "value", -label, -comparison, -t) %>%
  ggplot(
    data = .,
    aes(x = t, y = value, group = label, color = label)
  ) + geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(metric ~ ., scales = "free_y")
```

The results suggest a few things:

* treating death as a censoring event targets an estimand that is probably not relevant (it assumes infection could be observed at some point after death)
* what is happening on other leaves within the same plant is relevant (i.e. interference does appear to be at play here)
* the definition of the "priority effect" needs consideration of the scale of the contrast. The probability of these states is shrinkingly small as a leaf ages, so is a relative risk of two unlikely events the relevant measure for a priority effect?
